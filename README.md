# j-chess-client-python

This repository aims to be a starting point for implementing a chess ai for the j-chess-server in python.

To start, you can copy this repository and add an Ai that extends from BaseAi and call the client with it and you should be ready to go.


To regenerate the classes from the xsd, call 
```
xsdata .\xsd\jChessMessage.xsd --package j-chess-generated
```
